Im using TDD develpent based on the assignment.md which means every point from the "Behavior" section should be tested from the unittest:
    - basket_pricer/basket_pricer_test/test_basket_pricer.py

To run such tests I'm using python unittest with the command: "python -m unittest test_basket_pricer.BasketPricerTest"
