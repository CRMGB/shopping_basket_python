SHOPPING BASKET PYTHON

Im using TDD developent based on the assignment.md which means every point from the "Behavior" section in the assignment.md should be tested from the unittest file:
    - basket_pricer/basket_pricer_test/test_basket_pricer.py

To run such tests I'm using python unittest with the command from basket_pricer/basket_pricer_tests: "python -m unittest test_basket_pricer.BasketPricerTest"

I've tried the minimal amount of test to show my code works so I don't create a large file but obviously you can add more cases and they should pass.

There is a consideration for the error management raising Value Error as well as testing it.

No hardcoded data has been set as the assignment suggests but there are a few dictionaries for testing purposes in the test_basket_pricer.py in the simplest way and sticking to the examples.

The python version used is 3.8.5 with virtual environment but the code used should be good to go in previous versions.

Read assignment for full description.
